# Surfs Up
## Overview
### Introduction
#### You have decided to open a surf and ice cream shop on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. To get the project started through you need investors. W. Avy was once a famous surfer who has interest in the oppurtunity. He is worried about the weather patterns though and requested an analysis. 
### Purpose
#### Before he invests, W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends. He specifically wants the temperature data for the months of June and December on the island of Oahu. He wants to make sure that the surf shop will be sustainable as a year-round venture.

## Results
#### When comparing the results of June and December we are able to see a couple of key differences.
* When comparing the means of the two months we are able to see that overall June has a higher average temperature. June has an average temperature of 74.94 degrees while December has an average of 71.04. This is not a drastic difference but June is slightly higer.

* The coldest that it got during the month of June was 8 degrese higher than the minimum in December. In June the minimum temperature was 64.0 degrees while in December ut got down to 56.0.

* The max temperature between the two months was the most similar. For June the max temp was 85 and in December it was 83.

## Summary
#### When looking at the data between the two months we are able to see that Oahu would likely be a good place to build a shop. The difference between the averages between the two months us only about 4 degrees. The standard deviation is only  .5 difference so the vaurablilty between the two months is also not something of concern. The low in december is only 8 degrees lower than that in June which is not very significat as the highes are only 2 degrees apart. Overall the temperature variation between the two months is very minimal.
#### To make sure that the rest of the year was also similar I did the analysis for March and September so we would have one month from all 4 seasons. This showed me that these months were also very similar in temperature. March had a mean of 70.05, a minimum of 56, and a max of 82. September had an average of 76, a minimum of 64, and a max of 87. Both of these months had very similar temperature patterns to June and December which helps to show that Oahu has a consistently good weather pattern for a surf and ice cream shop year round.
